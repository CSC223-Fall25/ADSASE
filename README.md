# PA1: StackOverflow Developer Survey

## Background

StackOverflow is a popular question and answer website for developers. Every year, they conduct a survey of developers to understand the tools they use, the technologies they work with, and the challenges they face. The survey data is publicly available and can be downloaded from the StackOverflow website. It is the most comprehensive survey of software developers and programmer, and provides a wealth of information about the developer community. 

The survey goes back to 2011 and is conducted annually. You can access the survey results at [this link](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).
