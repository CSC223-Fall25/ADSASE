25. Write your general impressions of the survey results. What did you find most interesting? What did you find most surprising? What did you find most concerning?
I find it most interesting that a lot of people aren't worried about AI taking their jobs in the future. The way the media makes it seems is as if AI is going to take over the world as it continues to progress so I find it interesting that people aren't worried at all. The most suprising and concerning thing to me is that there is a high percentage of people that are not satisfied with thier developer roless 32.1% of people are not happy at work and 47.7% are complacent. I don't think that is a good image for the industry at all and I hope that it will eventually change.
