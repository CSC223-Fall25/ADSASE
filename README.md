5. Before you read the survey results, come up with top five questions you would like answered about the software industry and life of a software developer? 

What are the diffrences between working for a large company vs a small company?
How hard is it to change the field you work in. For example going from Mobile Development to Game Development?
What are red flags about a job I should look out for?
Do software developers ever use google to look something up within work?

6. The first thing you should do when reading a survey is to understand the methodology, particularly the sample size and how any biases in the sample may affect the results. What is the sample size (number of respondents) of the survey? 
65,437

7. Do you spot any potential biases in the survey that might not make the results truly representative of the developer community?
The survey does not question what kind of person the developer is. For example the survey lacks questions about gender, nationality, or country of residence. Does not take in account where the userers are from or who they really are.

8. What are the most popular programming languages in 2024, amongst all respondents? How do the results of professional developers compare with respondents learning to code?

9. Are you surprised by the results of the previous question? Why or why not? Speculate on why the results are the way they are.
Not that surprised becasue in a language like JavaScript you can do both front end and back end development. For the other programs I didn't know how widespread they were being used so I was surprised to see TypeScript and SQL were that popular. 

10. How many of the 10 most popular programming languages in 2024 are you familiar with / proficient in?

in general, the survey results were as expected. Although, Comparing last year to this year and seeing the salaries drop, was kind of sad.
The most intersting thing I saw was the amount of people say they are not satisfied at their job or complacent, yet 68% of developers code outside of work as a hobby. The most surprising thing I saw was that Starting a free trial is the most common way to evaluate new tools. The most concerning part I saw was that over 63% of developers spend at least 30 minutes searching for answers/solutions online.
