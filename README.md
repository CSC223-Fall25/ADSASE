# PA1: StackOverflow Developer Survey

## Background

StackOverflow is a popular question and answer website for developers. Every year, they conduct a survey of developers to understand the tools they use, the technologies they work with, and the challenges they face. The survey data is publicly available and can be downloaded from the StackOverflow website. It is the most comprehensive survey of software developers and programmer, and provides a wealth of information about the developer community. 

The survey goes back to 2011 and is conducted annually. You can access the survey results at [this link](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).

- [x] CSC-348: Game Design and Development

2. Do you intend to pursue a career in software development?

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No

3. Are you more interested in front-end or back-end development? Front-end development involves working on the user interface and user experience of a website or application. Back-end development involves working on the server-side of a website or application, including databases and server-side programming focused on algorithms, data processing, and business logic.

- [x] Back-end development

4. What kind of computer programming are you most interested in?

- [ ] Web development
- [ ] Mobile development
- [ ] Game development
- [ ] Data science
- [ ] Machine learning
- [x] Embedded systems 

5. Before you read the survey results, come up with top five questions you would like answered about the software industry and life of a software developer? 
How do you stay up to date once you are out of school?
Is a master necessary to be a software developer?
How does AI contribute to producing better results in this industry?
What are the most popular languages to learn to become a software developer?
What is your worklife balance?


6. The first thing you should do when reading a survey is to understand the methodology, particularly the sample size and how any biases in the sample may affect the results. What is the sample size (number of respondents) of the survey? 
There were 65 437 participants.


7. Do you spot any potential biases in the survey that might not make the results truly representative of the developer community?
It is not representative of the whole world as most of the participants are from the US. From one country to another education is different and ressources are different. 


8. What are the most popular programming languages in 2024, amongst all respondents? How do the results of professional developers compare with respondents learning to code?
Python is popular for those learning to code. JavaScript seems to be the most popular overall.


9. Are you surprised by the results of the previous question? Why or why not? Speculate on why the results are the way they are.
I think python is the most popular among learner because it is a high level language that easier to use but can still do a lot. I don't know why JavaScript is the most popular overall as I never used that language, but I am assuming it is both easy to use and efficient.


10. How many of the 10 most popular programming languages in 2024 are you familiar with / proficient in?
I only know python and have started reading more about C++.


11. Have you worked with databases, and if so, which database systems have you used? Where do these databases rank in the survey results for the most popular databases in 2024?
I worked with a database before to analyse bird sounds but it is not in the list.


12. What is the most popular IDE in 2024, amongst all respondents? Which ones do you use from the top 10?
VS code is the most popular. I also use VS code.


13. CSC-272: Data Mining last semester covered Pandas and Scikit-learn. CSC-372: Machine Learning this semester covers PyTorch and Numpy. What percentage of respondents use these frameworks / libraries in 2024?
Pandas: 20,7%
Scikit-learn: 10,6%
Pytorch: 10,6%
Numpy: 21,2%


14. What technologies do you want to learn in the future? How do your choices compare with "Worked with vs. want to work" with section of the suvey? 
I want to learn C because I was told it was a good language to learn and apparently 13% of the participants also whant to learn that language and 47,4% admire it.


15. Do you have a preference for working in-person or remotely or a mix of both? 

- [ ] In-person
- [ ] Remote
- [x] Hybrid

15. How do your preferences compare with the survey results?
Most percentage is hybrid but there is an increase in wanting to be in-person probably for the social side of it. I just think that meeting and interacting with the people you work with is good but it doesn't have to be everyday, there are things I can do from home.

16. Do you currently use AI tools in your development process? 

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No, but I plan to soon 
- [ ] No, and I don't plan to

17. How do your choices compare with the survey results?
most people use AI nowadays and if you don't learn how to use it there is a chance for you to fall behind which is why I want to start using it.


18. How favorable is your stance on using AI tools as part of your development workflow?

- [ ] Very favorable
- [x] Favorable
- [ ] Indifferent
- [ ] Unsure 
- [ ] Unfavorable
- [ ] Very unfavorable

19. How do your choices compare with the survey results?

I am favorable to that like 48% of the people that took the survey.


20. Do you believe AI is a threat to your future career prospects?

- [ ] Yes
- [x] I'm not sure
- [ ] No

21. How do your choices compare with the survey results?

Most developer think it is not a threat and just a tool to help programer. I personally don't have an opinion on that yet.

22. Do you code outside of course work? How do your choices compare with the survey results?

The majority of developpers code outside of their work place as a hobby. I personally don't during the year as my days are very busy but I try during break and summer.

23. What percentage of respondents are satisfied in their current professional developer role?

The majority of developers are complacent at work (47,7%) and only a minority is satisfied/happy at their work (20.2%).

24. What is the median salary of developers who work with Bash/Shell (pwd, ls, mkdir, cd..)? 

Their median salary is $75 184.

25. Write your general impressions of the survey results. What did you find most interesting? What did you find most surprising? What did you find most concerning?

I think that it is suprising how many people seem like they are just settling for their job while most people program as a hobby outside of their work. This reflects a great passion people have in this field that is not reflected in the work place.
