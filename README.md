5. Before you read the survey results, come up with top five questions you would like answered about the software industry and life of a software developer? 
    How often are you told to do something that is very dificult but others insist it would be easy?
    Are you more fruserated searching and implenting others libraries or creating your own setlist/library?
    Are happy with the specific software development job you currently have?
    what is your favorite part of your job?
    Do you often have super late nights (12:00+)

    The 2024 sample size is 65,437.
7. Do you spot any potential biases in the survey that might not make the results truly representative of the developer community?

8. What are the most popular programming languages in 2024, amongst all respondents? How do the results of professional developers compare with respondents learning to code?
    Amongst all respondents the top languages are JS, HTMS/CSS, and PY. Those learning to code tend to favor PY mostlikly because of how abstract and simple it is to learn.
9. Are you surprised by the results of the previous question? Why or why not? Speculate on why the results are the way they are.
    I am not too suprised. PY, HTML, and JS were always the top languages in and out of school. Only if you are working in a niche system for a specific purpose do you learn other lesser known lanugages

25. Write your general impressions of the survey results. What did you find most interesting? What did you find most surprising? What did you find most concerning?
    I love seeing a screenshot of the software community seeing how diferent developer types all have different responses. Something I thought was suppring was that I was under the impression that banking was primarily run on cobal, pherhaps they had made a giant update to their systems since my dads time. I was supprised and concenred seeing a 10k USD drop of salaries on average, either a bubble popped or software development is in dire straights.
