# PA1: StackOverflow Developer Survey

## Background

StackOverflow is a popular question and answer website for developers. Every year, they conduct a survey of developers to understand the tools they use, the technologies they work with, and the challenges they face. The survey data is publicly available and can be downloaded from the StackOverflow website. It is the most comprehensive survey of software developers and programmer, and provides a wealth of information about the developer community. 

The survey goes back to 2011 and is conducted annually. You can access the survey results at [this link](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/). 

## Instructions 

For the following questions, you will be using the 2024 StackOverflow Developer Survey. 

First you would have to fork the repository to your GitHub account. Then clone the repository to your local machine.

There are 25 questions in total. To answer the questions, directly edit this file by adding text after the questions. To pick an option in the checkboxes, put an `x` between the brackets. For example, `[x]`. 

When you have answered all the questions, add->commit->push the changes to your forked GitHub repository and create a Pull Request. 

## Questions

- [ ] Embedded systems 

5. Before you read the survey results, come up with top five questions you would like answered about the software industry and life of a software developer? 
    1. How does a typical day in the life of a software engineer look like?
    2. What is the base salary of a junior developer?
    3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of working remotely as a sogtware engineer?
    4. What AI tools are important to take advantage of in your role as a software engineer?
    5. What other than financial benefits does working as SWE bring?

6. The first thing you should do when reading a survey is to understand the methodology, particularly the sample size and how any biases in the sample may affect the results. What is the sample size (number of respondents) of the survey? 
   There are 65,437 respondents. 
7. Do you spot any potential biases in the survey that might not make the results truly representative of the developer community?
    There are biases in the fact that there is nothing about ethnicity, sex or gender. Another bias could possible be that those who filled the servey are mostly web developers who take advantage of programming languages like JS and HTML/CSS. 
8. What are the most popular programming languages in 2024, amongst all respondents? How do the results of professional developers compare with respondents learning to code?
    - The most popular programming languages are Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python and SQL, while Rust is the most admired programing language with the score of 83%. 

9. Are you surprised by the results of the previous question? Why or why not? Speculate on why the results are the way they are.
    - I am not surprised by this result as it is consistent with previous years and it links well to Atwood Law. The fact that JS is the most popular makes sense in a way that it has a combination of front-end and back-end development as well as it is highly technical, meaning that its capabilities allow developers to achieve wide variety of tasks. It should also be noted that it might be biased as it could be that the servey was filled out by web developers mostly rather than software engineers. 

10. How many of the 10 most popular programming languages in 2024 are you familiar with / proficient in?
    - I am familiar with or have some exposure working with 3 programming languages out of top 10 - Python, HTML/CSS, SQL. 

11. Have you worked with databases, and if so, which database systems have you used? Where do these databases rank in the survey results for the most popular databases in 2024?
 - I have not worked with databases before this semester. Now I am taking Database Managements Systems course and we are working with MySQl, Oracle and MongoDB this semester. All of these databases are in the top 10, with MySQL ranking 2nd. 

12. What is the most popular IDE in 2024, amongst all respondents? Which ones do you use from the top 10?
    - The most popular one is VS Code and I think it is quite accurate as every developer that I have talked to, all use VS Code. I also use VS Code. I have also worked with Jupiter Notebook in CSC 105 and just started with nano in this class. 

13. CSC-272: Data Mining last semester covered Pandas and Scikit-learn. CSC-372: Machine Learning this semester covers PyTorch and Numpy. What percentage of respondents use these frameworks / libraries in 2024?
    - Pandas - 20.7% 
    - Scikit-Learn - 10.6%
    - PyTorch - 10.6%
    - Numpy - 21.2%

14. What technologies do you want to learn in the future? How do your choices compare with "Worked with vs. want to work" with section of the suvey? 
    - In the future, I want to learn more about Java and JavaScript as those are one of the most popular languages and I have yet to work with them. The survey says that on average, each user who is learning how to code want to learn at least 12 other languages, which is shocking as to why would you need to learn this many languages. JS and Python are top of the list which makes sense, JS matches with my desire. 

15. Do you have a preference for working in-person or remotely or a mix of both? 

- [ ] In-person
- [ ] Remote
- [X] Hybrid

15. How do your preferences compare with the survey results?
    - 42% of respondents also prefer hybrid and I think it is a good balance to have between office and remote work. Remote is also 38% which is not that far off. 

16. Do you currently use AI tools in your development process? 

- [X] Yes
- [ ] No, but I plan to soon 
- [ ] No, and I don't plan to

17. How do your choices compare with the survey results?
    - Approximately 62% of respondents also responded Yes on their AI usage. It would not make sense of a developer to not take advantage of this resource if they want to stay competitive. 
18. How favorable is your stance on using AI tools as part of your development workflow?

- [] Very favorable
- [X] Favorable
- [ ] Indifferent
- [ ] Unsure 
- [ ] Unfavorable
- [ ] Very unfavorable

19. How do your choices compare with the survey results?
    - Overall, it matches my answers as 48% of respondentsbelieve that it is favorable. It improve your efficiency and saves time, however it would not fit the very favorable category due its lack of desire results and not being able to perform complicated tasks. 

20. Do you believe AI is a threat to your future career prospects?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] I'm not sure
- [X] No

21. How do your choices compare with the survey results?
    - As expected, 68% of respondent also agree with me. It is a tool to improve eficiency of your work, not to take over. Calculators did not take over mathematitians when they were released. 

22. Do you code outside of course work? How do your choices compare with the survey results?
    - Yes, I do when working on my personal project or personal portfolio website. It is surprising that 68% of respondents also do it as a hobby, which is crazy to me. It is good to code for building something meaningful that would be impactful in real world, but I dont get the hobby part of it. 

23. What percentage of respondents are satisfied in their current professional developer role?
    - 20.2% of workers are happy, while 47.7% are complacent. 

24. What is the median salary of developers who work with Bash/Shell (pwd, ls, mkdir, cd..)? 
    - It is around $75,000 for Bash/Shell.

25. Write your general impressions of the survey results. What did you find most interesting? What did you find most surprising? What did you find most concerning?
    - Overall, I think I already had a good understanding of the results even before looking att is survey results. Most of the answers that I had matched with the developers who responded to this survey and the part that I found most interesting is the fact that for some reason I thought that more developers would be scared of AI taking over, but I was pleasantly surprised that it is not the case. I also was surprised at the amount of respondents who do coding as a hobby. But, I guess it all comes down to personal experience.
