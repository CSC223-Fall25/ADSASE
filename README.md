# PA1: StackOverflow Developer Survey

## Background

StackOverflow is a popular question and answer website for developers. Every year, they conduct a survey of developers to understand the tools they use, the technologies they work with, and the challenges they face. The survey data is publicly available and can be downloaded from the StackOverflow website. It is the most comprehensive survey of software developers and programmer, and provides a wealth of information about the developer community. 

The survey goes back to 2011 and is conducted annually. You can access the survey results at [this link](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).

5. Before you read the survey results, come up with top five questions you would like answered about the software industry and life of a software developer? 
How much do you use AI while programming?
Do you think your salary will be affected by AI?
How many languages do you have to know/use?
How do you learn new things within your field once entering the workforce?
Do you work remote or in an office or hybrid?

6. The first thing you should do when reading a survey is to understand the methodology, particularly the sample size and how any biases in the sample may affect the results. What is the sample size (number of respondents) of the survey?
65,437 respondents 

7. Do you spot any potential biases in the survey that might not make the results truly representative of the developer community?
There may be a bias because the US was more represented which could cause results to be skewed.

8. What are the most popular programming languages in 2024, amongst all respondents? How do the results of professional developers compare with respondents learning to code?
The most popular programming languages amongst all respondents are JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, and SQL. Professional Developers most popular languages are JavaScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS. Learning to code respondents favored Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.

9. Are you surprised by the results of the previous question? Why or why not? Speculate on why the results are the way they are.
I am not really surprised by the results of the previous question because the most popular languages are the languages you hear the most in the computer science community and what is being taught in school. I think that the reason Python is more popular among respondents learning to code because it is the more popular language from what I can tell and it is more easier to learn. 

10. How many of the 10 most popular programming languages in 2024 are you familiar with / proficient in?
I am familiar with JavaScript. I am proficient in Python, HTML, and SQL.

11. Have you worked with databases, and if so, which database systems have you used? Where do these databases rank in the survey results for the most popular databases in 2024?
I have used MySQL and that is ranked number 2 among all respondents.

12. What is the most popular IDE in 2024, amongst all respondents? Which ones do you use from the top 10?\
The most popular IDE amongst all respondents is Visual Studio Code. I ahve worked with Visual Studio Code and Spyder.

13. CSC-272: Data Mining last semester covered Pandas and Scikit-learn. CSC-372: Machine Learning this semester covers PyTorch and Numpy. What percentage of respondents use these frameworks / libraries in 2024?
Pandas is used 20.7% of the time. Scikit-learn is used 10.6% of the time. PyTourch is used 10.6% of the time. NumPy is used 21.2% of the time.

14. What technologies do you want to learn in the future? How do your choices compare with "Worked with vs. want to work" with section of the suvey? 
I would like to work more with JavaScrip, C, C#, and C++ in the future becasue those seem to be the most popular languages and foundational languages. I match with 15444 people who have worked with Python and want to work with JavaScript.

15. Do you have a preference for working in-person or remotely or a mix of both? 

- [ ] In-person
- [ ] Remote
- [x] Hybrid

15. How do your preferences compare with the survey results?
I match with 42% of respondents who do work hybrid. Hybrid work is a good medium between the 2 and because of covid remote/hybrid work is easier than before. Also computer science is a field of study that is easier to work remote/hybrid.

16. Do you currently use AI tools in your development process? 

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No, but I plan to soon 
- [ ] No, and I don't plan to

17. How do your choices compare with the survey results?
I match with 13.8% of the respondents who do not use AI but plan to soon. The majority of the respondents do use AI in their development process and I think this is because of the fast growing use and development of AI.

18. How favorable is your stance on using AI tools as part of your development workflow?


- [ ] Very favorable
- [ ] Favorable
- [x] Indifferent
- [ ] Unsure 
- [ ] Unfavorable
- [ ] Very unfavorable

19. How do your choices compare with the survey results?
I match with 18.7% of respondents who are indifferent towards the use of AI in development. I think this is because AI is getting a bad reputation, especially in the school world so I can see why some people are still not favorable or indifferent to it.

20. Do you believe AI is a threat to your future career prospects?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] I'm not sure
- [x] No

21. How do your choices compare with the survey results?

$75,184 is the median salary of developers who work with Bash/Shell.

25. Write your general impressions of the survey results. What did you find most interesting? What did you find most surprising? What did you find most concerning?
I found the survey very interesting and informative. I found the rankings of languages most interesting and I found how much people code outside of work surprising. I found this surprising because I didn't think that many people would code outside of work as a hobby.
