# PA1: StackOverflow Developer Survey

## Background

StackOverflow is a popular question and answer website for developers. Every year, they conduct a survey of developers to understand the tools they use, the technologies they work with, and the challenges they face. The survey data is publicly available and can be downloaded from the StackOverflow website. It is the most comprehensive survey of software developers and programmer, and provides a wealth of information about the developer community. 

The survey goes back to 2011 and is conducted annually. You can access the survey results at [this link](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/). 

## Instructions 

For the following questions, you will be using the 2024 StackOverflow Developer Survey. 

First you would have to fork the repository to your GitHub account. Then clone the repository to your local machine.

There are 25 questions in total. To answer the questions, directly edit this file by adding text after the questions. To pick an option in the checkboxes, put an `x` between the brackets. For example, `[x]`. 

When you have answered all the questions, add->commit->push the changes to your forked GitHub repository and create a Pull Request.

- [ ] Embedded systems 

5. Before you read the survey results, come up with top five questions you would like answered about the software industry and life of a software developer?

	- What are the pros and cons of working remote in a Computer Science job?
	- Are there any jobs that involve more interaction with people than just coding?
	- Although jobs are everywhere, what places in the U.S. are most committed to CS development?
	- One of my interests is environmental activism. What kinds of opportunities are there for CS/data science workers?
	- What can make you stand out as an applicant to jobs?

6. The first thing you should do when reading a survey is to understand the methodology, particularly the sample size and how any biases in the sample may affect the results. What is the sample size (number of respondents) of the survey? 

	- The sample size is 65437 people.

7. Do you spot any potential biases in the survey that might not make the results truly representative of the developer community?

	- Most of the people who actually took the survey were from the U.S. and/or part of the StackOverflow community, which might not be representative of the entire development community.

8. What are the most popular programming languages in 2024, amongst all respondents? How do the results of professional developers compare with respondents learning to code?

	- Rust, JavaScript, Python, and SQL are the most popular this year. Python is becoming increasingly popular with those in professional development.

9. Are you surprised by the results of the previous question? Why or why not? Speculate on why the results are the way they are.

	- I wasn't expecting Rust to pop up. There are a few YouTubers that I watch who do some coding, and although Rust was mentioned, I wasn't sure what it was.

10. How many of the 10 most popular programming languages in 2024 are you familiar with / proficient in?

	- Python encompasses the extent of my programming language. I have worked with others, but to such a minimal degree that I remember nothing from them.

11. Have you worked with databases, and if so, which database systems have you used? Where do these databases rank in the survey results for the most popular databases in 2024?

	- Sadly, I haven't done anything with databases yet.

12. What is the most popular IDE in 2024, amongst all respondents? Which ones do you use from the top 10?

	- Visual Studio Code is the most popular, and that's also the only one that I used from the top 10.

13. CSC-272: Data Mining last semester covered Pandas and Scikit-learn. CSC-372: Machine Learning this semester covers PyTorch and Numpy. What percentage of respondents use these frameworks / libraries in 2024?

	- Pandas: 20.7%
	- Scikit-learn: 10.6%
	- PyTorch: 10.6%
	- Numpy: 21.2%

14. What technologies do you want to learn in the future? How do your choices compare with "Worked with vs. want to work" with section of the survey?

	- I'd love to learn more coding languages, but there isn't anything that I want to learn in particular aside from that, just not webpage stuff. Most people want to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Python.

15. Do you have a preference for working in-person or remotely or a mix of both? 

- [ ] In-person
- [ ] Remote
- [X] Hybrid

15. How do your preferences compare with the survey results?

	- Most people want to be either offline or remote.

16. Do you currently use AI tools in your development process? 

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No, but I plan to soon
- [X] No, and I don't plan to

17. How do your choices compare with the survey results?

	- Most people use AI in one form or another for code development.

18. How favorable is your stance on using AI tools as part of your development workflow?

- [ ] Very favorable
- [ ] Favorable
- [X] Indifferent
- [ ] Unsure 
- [ ] Unfavorable
- [ ] Very unfavorable

19. How do your choices compare with the survey results?

	- Most people are favorable, while indifference is a good bit less common.

20. Do you believe AI is a threat to your future career prospects?

- [X] Yes
- [ ] I'm not sure
- [ ] No

21. How do your choices compare with the survey results?

	- A very significant amount of developers think that AI is not a threat to their job.

22. Do you code outside of course work? How do your choices compare with the survey results?

	- A little bit, mostly just for fun. Most people code outside of work as a hobby, and the next most people coded for professional development.

23. What percentage of respondents are satisfied in their current professional developer role?

	- 20.2% are happy, and 47.7% are only complacent. The rest are unhappy.

24. What is the median salary of developers who work with Bash/Shell (pwd, ls, mkdir, cd..)? 

	- The median salary is $75,000.

25. Write your general impressions of the survey results. What did you find most interesting? What did you find most surprising? What did you find most concerning?

	- I found the opinions on AI to be pretty interesting, as they were kind of the opposite of what I expected. There weren't many concerns for me, though. All the stuff that I saw about AI just indicated to me that clearly developers know something that I don't, as they weren't super concerned.
