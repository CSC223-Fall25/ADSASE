## Background

StackOverflow is a popular question and answer website for developers. Every year, they conduct a survey of developers to understand the tools they use, the technologies they work with, and the challenges they face. The survey data is publicly available and can be downloaded from the StackOverflow website. It is the most comprehensive survey of software developers and programmer, and provides a wealth of information about the developer community. 

The survey goes back to 2011 and is conducted annually. You can access the survey results at [this link](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).

5. Before you read the survey results, come up with top five questions you would like answered about the software industry and life of a software developer? 
	1) Which aspect of Computer Science is favored the most?
	2) Is front-end development more favorable then back-end development?
	3) Would you rather work in person or at home, or both?
	4) Are developers happy with their work? 
	5) Does AI ultimately impact or hurt developers work?
6. The first thing you should do when reading a survey is to understand the methodology, particularly the sample size and how any biases in the sample may affect the results. What is the sample size (number of respondents) of the survey? 
 - Over 65,000 developers (65,437)

- Sciki-Learn: 10.6%
- PyTorch: 10.6%
